Used Python because it’s easy, took me only 10-15 minutes and 7 lines of code.
Install phonenumbers library.

How my code works-
1. First it asks user to enter the number in string format.
2. Then parse it as US phone number.
3. Checks if number is valid or not. If it’s valid number, then format it in E164 phone number format. Else print not a valid number.
